Local binary patterns:
- 1-bit delta ADC

Federated learning

K-means clustering of raw hypervectors to find centroids
- possibly multiple centroids per label
- can get different sub-types of labels, e.g. starting fist, holding fist, etc.

FPGA implementation

Push the number of channels to 96 or 128
